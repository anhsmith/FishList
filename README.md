# FishList

This is a centralised list of fishes for EventMeasure for my lab.

It was made from the species in https://github.com/anhsmith/DuffyNZReefFish, with some additions. 

The file to be used is MasseySpeciesList.txt. Additional info is in the MasseySpeciesListInfo.csv

The authority used for species names is:
