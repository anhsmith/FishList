# FishList

This is a centralised list of fishes for EventMeasure for my lab.

The current version is made from the species in https://github.com/anhsmith/DuffyNZReefFish. The species names are validated using fishbase and Te Papa. 

The file to be used is MasseySpeciesList.txt

It has not yet been tested with EventMeasure.
